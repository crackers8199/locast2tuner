# Rewrite endpoint
Locast.org uses CDNs to determine the best streaming location for your IP address, but this might not always be the best option. In case you experience stutter or buffering, you might want to use the `rewrite_endpoint` option. E.g. if you want to make sure you stream from `lax.locastnet.org`, you simply supply `--rewrite_endpoint lax.locastnet.org`.
